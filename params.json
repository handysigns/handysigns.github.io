The hand signals are static and designed to transmit efficiently over video making it useful for video conferencing. Handy signs can also be utilised for group meetings, presentations, and speeches.\r\n\r\n# Purpose\r\n* Being efficient in video conference call setup\r\n* Improving audio quality over video conferencing\r\n* Gathering group consensus\r\n* Ability to signal about necessary adjustments for the video conference (eg: disruptive background noise that needs to be muted) without stopping the flow of the meeting.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\nThe transmitting node holds the signal in view of the receiving node. In the case of video conferencing, ensure the signal is in view of the camera. The signal is held by the sending node until acknowledged by the receiving node.\r\n\r\n# Signals\r\n## What is my audio quality?\r\n### Usage\r\nDetermine how audio is being received by the other nodes.\r\n\r\n### Gesture\r\n* Back of hand facing camera.\r\n* Fingers spread.\r\n* Response\r\n\r\n![What is my audio quality?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/handysigns/handysigns/master/images/gestures/what_is_my_audio_quality%3F.jpg?raw=true \"What is my audio quality?\")\r\n\r\n## Signal audio quality.\r\nYour audio quality is (0-5).\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nRate received audio quality on scale from zero (nothing heard) to five (loud and clear).\r\n\r\n### Gesture\r\n* 0 - fist with palm facing camera.\r\n* 1 - one finger raised from fist palm facing camera.\r\n* â€¦\r\n* 5 - fingers spread with palm facing camera.\r\n\r\n![Quality level 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/handysigns/handysigns/master/images/gestures/quality_1.jpg?raw=true \"Quality level 1\")\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n![Quality level 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/handysigns/handysigns/master/images/gestures/quality_5.jpg?raw=true \"Quality level 5\")\r\n\r\n## I am not receiving you\r\n### Usage\r\nCommunicate not audio being received from another node.\r\n\r\n### Gesture\r\n\r\nMake fist\r\nPalm facing camera (same signal as your audio quality is 0).\r\n\r\n![I am not receiving you](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/handysigns/handysigns/master/images/gestures/I_am_not_receiving_you.jpg?raw=true \"I am not receiving you\")\r\n\r\n## Mute your mic\r\n### Usage\r\nAsk node to mute their mic.\r\n\r\n### Gesture\r\n* Make fist \r\n* Back of hand facing camera\r\n\r\n![Mute your mic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/handysigns/handysigns/master/images/gestures/mute_your_mic.jpg?raw=true \"Mute your mic\")\r\n\r\n## Can you hear me?\r\n### Usage\r\nDetermine if other nodes are receiving audio.\r\n\r\n### Gesture\r\n* Cupped hand\r\n* Thumb close to ear\r\n* Palm facing camera\r\n\r\n![Can you hear me?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/handysigns/handysigns/master/images/gestures/can_you_hear_me%3F.jpg?raw=true \"Can you hear me?\")\r\n\r\n### Response\r\nYes or No hand signal.\r\n\r\n## Yes / Approve\r\n### Usage\r\nCommunicate affirmative or approval to other nodes.\r\n\r\n### Gesture\r\n* Make fist \r\n* Thumb pointing up\r\n\r\n![Yes / Approve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/handysigns/handysigns/master/images/gestures/yes-approve.jpg?raw=true \"Yes / Approve\")\r\n\r\n## No / Disapprove\r\n### Usage\r\nCommunicate negative or disapproval to other nodes.\r\n\r\n### Gesture\r\n* Make fist\r\n* Thumb pointing down\r\n\r\n![No / Disapprove](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/handysigns/handysigns/master/images/gestures/no-disapprove.jpg?raw=true \"No / Disapprove\")\r\n\r\n## Resend\r\n### Usage\r\nRequest node re transmit recently send packets.\r\n\r\n### Gesture\r\n* Cupped hand into a circle\r\n* Pinky finger facing camera\r\n* All fingers together\r\n* Thumb touching index finger to make circle\r\n\r\n![Resend](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/handysigns/handysigns/master/images/gestures/resend.jpg?raw=true \"Resend\")\r\n\r\n### Response\r\nNode will retransmit previous packets.\r\n\r\n##Adjust your video framing\r\n### Usage\r\nRequest node adjust video framing.\r\n\r\n### Gesture\r\n* Pistol grip\r\n* Index finger and thumb extended at right angles\r\n\r\n![Adjust your video framing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/handysigns/handysigns/master/images/gestures/adjust_framing.jpg?raw=true \"Adjust your video framing\")\r\n\r\n## Video off\r\n### Usage\r\nSending or receiving nodes change to audio only mode.\r\n\r\n### Gesture\r\n* Hand with fingers spread in between eyes and camera\r\n* Palm facing forward\r\n\r\n### Response\r\n* Node shuts of video\r\n* And/Or you shut your video off\r\n* Audio continues\r\n\r\n![Video off](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/handysigns/handysigns/master/images/gestures/video_off.jpg?raw=true \"Video off\")\r\n\r\n## There is background noise\r\n### Usage\r\nNode is receiving background noise.\r\n\r\n### Gesture\r\n* Fingers in the shape of a claw\r\n* Fingertips toward and near ear\r\n* Blade of hand towards camera\r\n\r\n![Background Noise](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/handysigns/handysigns/master/images/gestures/background_noise.jpg?raw=true \"Background Noise\")\r\n\r\n### Response\r\n* Node will stop background noise\r\n* Node will mute mic\r\n\r\n## Reestablish call\r\n### Usage\r\nNode needs to reestablish call because of bad connection.\r\n### Gesture\r\n* Arm diagonal across camera frame\r\n* Hand pointing up and to the left\r\n\r\n![Reestablish call](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/handysigns/handysigns/master/images/gestures/reestablish_call.jpg?raw=true \"Reestablish call\")\r\n\r\n### Response\r\nNode will disconnect call and reestablish the call.","google":"UA-51676980-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
